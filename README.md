# 🌾 2025_PGA_Workshop-Feb
🌿 Peru PGA Workshop in February 26 2025 🌿

### This workshop will teach you the GDD calculation process. Specifically, it aims to develop skills of capacity to apply GDD calculations to the Peruvian gridded meteorological station. 

- You can run the code directly in Colab by clicking "***Open in Colab***" on the code in the `Simple Calc GDD` folder.

### Phenology serves as an essential tool for understanding the temporal rhythms of nature and assessing the impact of human activities and environmental changes.

**Phenology** studies periodic biological phenomena in living organisms, particularly plants and animals, relating to seasonal changes. 
In plants, phenology explores the timing of key physiological events such as growth, development, and reproduction in response to environmental cues.

### Key Phenological Events in Plant
Major phenological events observed in plants include:
1.	Germination: The process of seeds sprouting and producing seedlings, primarily influenced by temperature and moisture conditions.
2.	Leafing: The emergence of new leaves, typically occurring in spring as temperatures rise and daylight increases.
3.	Flowering: The blooming depends on factors such as temperature, light exposure, and humidity.
4.	Fruiting: The development and maturation of fruits following successful pollination and fertilization.
5.	Leaf Fall: The changing color and shedding of leaves in autumn, triggered by shorter daylight hours and cooler temperatures.
6.	Dormancy: During winter, plants cease growth and conserve energy.
   
### Importance of Phenological Research
1.	Monitoring Climate Change: Phenological events are directly influenced by climate. For example, earlier spring flowering is often cited as evidence of global warming.
2.	Ecosystem Interactions: Changes in phenology can disrupt interactions between species, such as the timing mismatch between flowering plants and their pollinators.
3.	Agriculture and Forestry: Provides critical information for crop planting, harvesting, and forest management.
4.	Conservation Biology: Supports the management of habitats and ecological needs for endangered species.
   
### Methods
* Field Observations: Long-term records of phenological changes through direct observation.
* Satellite and Remote Sensing: Large-scale analysis of phenological patterns over wide geographical areas.
* Modeling: Predicting phenological changes based on climate data and trends.
